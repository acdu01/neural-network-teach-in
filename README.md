# Neural Network Teach-In 

This notebook is an interactive demo designed to help learners visualize and experiment with the mechanics of a simple feedforward neural network. By adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate, network size, and initial weights and biases, users can develop a hands-on understanding of how neural networks learn through backpropagation.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How input data flows through layers (forward propagation)
- How neural networks compute and minimize a cost function
- How gradients and partial derivatives are used during backpropagation
- The effect of learning rate and initialization on training dynamics

## How to Use

Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/acdu01/neural-network-teach-in.git
   cd neural-network-teach-in
```
